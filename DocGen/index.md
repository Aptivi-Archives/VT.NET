## What is VT.NET?

VT.NET is a VT sequence filtering library used to filter out text from these sequences.

## What is this web page?
 
This webpage is not a wiki for the general use of VT.NET; it's an API documentation for mod developers to be used as reference. It constantly gets updated as we push the updates to the main and servicing versions of VT.NET.

If you still intend to use a documentation specific to your preferred version of KS, you may refer to the [releases](https://github.com/Aptivi/VT.NET/releases) page of the project and download the attached `0.0.x.y-doc.rar` file.

To get started using the documentation, select `KS API` from the top menu and select a namespace to get a clear overview of the API that VT.NET provides.

## Feedback

If you wish to leave feedback to us about this API reference website, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Aptivi/VT.NET/issues) of the project.

If you wish to contribute to the documentation of the API, go to the VT.NET source code and make your improvements there on a draft [Pull Request](https://github.com/Aptivi/VT.NET/pulls); we don't support override files that are made by clicking on `Improve this doc`.

Any meaningful contributions are welcome.
